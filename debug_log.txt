Hello, I am a chat bot. Ask me anything.
Human: Is Donald Trump Jesus Christ?
Bot:  Sir are you actually serious?
Hello, I am a chat bot. Ask me anything.
Human: Is Donald Trump Jesus Christ?
Bot:  Sir are you actually serious?
Human: Yes
Bot:  Sir, I'm afraid you might have slipped a gear.
That shocked me; this was one of the smartest chatbots I've ever interacted with. I thought to myself: Just how capable is this thing? Some other human beings went up to it and posed genuinely complicated questions, and in each case the chatbot answered them thoroughly and coherently. This was unprecedented; the most advanced previous chatbot — IBM's Watson — had trouble answering anything but trivia questions such as Jeopardy! clues. How had Google achieved this?? I strode over to the computer on which the chatbot was running, and examined the source code in disbelief.
In my experience, few programmers have even a weak grasp of this fundamental fact
